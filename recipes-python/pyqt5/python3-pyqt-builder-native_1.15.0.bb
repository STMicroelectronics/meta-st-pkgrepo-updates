SUMMARY = "PEP 517 compliant PyQt build system for PyQt"
DESCRIPTION = "PyQt-builder is the PEP 517 compliant build system \
for PyQt and projects that extend PyQt. It extends the SIP build \
system and uses Qtâ€™s qmake to perform the actual compilation and \
installation of extension modules. \
\
Projects that use PyQt-builder provide an appropriate pyproject.toml \
file and an optional project.py script. Any PEP 517 compliant \
frontend, for example sip-install or pip can then be used to build \
and install the project."
